## Deployment
For deployment, first you need to deploy the server , you can do it just like we do any nodejs application

And for client , you need to replace one url before deployment of client,there is a variable in app.jsx file which is FAUCET_ENDPOINT, you need to put the deployed url of server there.

After updating the url just go to cd client and run yarn build , it will build the files deploy it
